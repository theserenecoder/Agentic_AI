       " [Document(metadata={'source': 'https://acera.ca/am-i-covered-if-i-need-to-cancel-a-trip/'}, page_content='\\n\\nAm I covered if I need to cancel a trip?\\n\\nWhile no one wants to cancel a trip, sometimes it’s necessary. But what if you’ve already booked flights and hotels – are you out of all that money? This will depend on the answers to these three questions:\\xa0\\n\\nDid you have trip cancellation travel insurance?\\xa0\\xa0\\nAre your bookings refundable?\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat is the reason you’re cancelling?\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ll explain why these factors matter and how they impact your ability to get refunded if you must cancel a trip.\\xa0\\nTrip Cancellation: Before You Leave\\nTrip cancellation travel insurance is designed to help you recoup your costs if you cancel a trip\\xa0before\\xa0you leave. Keep in mind that not all reasons for cancellation are covered – we’ll discuss that more below.\\xa0\\nExpenses that can be covered include airfare, accommodation, transportation, cancellation fees and more –\\xa0any non-refundable, unused prepaid travel arrangements.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRefundable and Non-Refundable Bookings\\xa0\\nThe first step will be to see if you can get any type of refund directly from where you booked. Your eligibility will depend on the vendor’s cancellation policy and the type of ticket you purchased.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, many airlines offer a basic fare that is nonrefundable. However, if you purchase a higher tier, you may be able to cancel and get a full refund.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn many cases, you may be able to cancel but will not be refunded the full amount. The vendor may keep an administration fee, charge a cancellation fee, or even keep an amount of the full cost. Trip cancellation coverage can help cover these expenses.\\xa0\\xa0\\nReason for Cancelling\\xa0\\nA few of the scenarios that can be covered by trip cancellation travel insurance include:\\xa0\\n\\nA personal medical or dental emergency\\xa0\\nA death or major illness in your family\\xa0\\nThe person you are travelling with has a change of plans due to a personal or family emergency\\xa0\\nYour destination has extreme weather such as a hurricane or flood\\xa0\\nYour flight or tour is cancelled or delayed\\xa0\\nYour visa to your destination is denied\\xa0\\nYour home is damaged, or business is inoperable due to an unforeseen event\\xa0\\nYou lost the financial resources needed to take the trip (i.e., you lost your job)\\xa0\\nYou contract COVID-19 and need to quarantine or self-isolate\\xa0\\n\\nIt’s important to note that not every circumstance is covered by a trip cancellation travel insurance policy. Some insurance companies may not offer coverage for COVID-19 or offer it only as an add-on. You may also be able to purchase ‘Cancel for Any Reason’ coverage – a much more expensive but comprehensive option.\\xa0\\nTrip Interruption: During the Trip\\nWhen your trip is cut short part-way through this is trip interruption. The reasons are largely the same as for a “cancellation” but the timing is different.\\nHowever, your insurance will not cover a trip interruption if you could have been reasonably informed that you would possibly have to interrupt your trip. For example:\\n\\nYou cancel your family’s Hawaii vacation because there’s a hurricane. Was it a freak storm with unlucky timing OR is this Hawaii’s hurricane season?\\nSadly your grandpa passes away. Was it an accident or unexpected illness OR was his health already in decline when you bought your plane ticket?\\nYou have a personal medical emergency or don’t have time to get the shots you need for travel. Did you remember to consult your doctor before you made your travel plans OR did you forget to plan ahead?\\nYour flight is delayed so you cancel the trip. However the flight takes off after an hour’s delay. Could you have waited instead of cancelling out of frustration?\\n\\nEnsure you know what qualifies for reimbursement and help getting home when it comes to trip interruption.\\nTravel Advisories\\xa0\\nMany travel insurance companies use official government websites like the Government of Canada’s\\xa0Travel Advice and Advisories\\xa0website as their basis of “reasonably informed.” If a recommendation or precaution is listed there before you book your vacation and you cancel your trip on account of one of those listed items, you will not receive compensation. However, if it is not listed or is added after you book your trip, you would be covered.\\xa0\\nFor example, let’s say in March you book a trip to Colombia for September. In July you decide to cancel the trip because you’re worried about a COVID-19 surge there. You would not receive compensation from your trip cancellation insurance because the Canadian Government had warned of the virus before you booked your trip. However, let’s say you cancelled your trip due to a new illness that you were concerned about. The government added a travel advisory after you booked your trip, so you would be covered as this illness was not listed at the time that you booked.\\xa0\\nCancelling a Trip\\xa0\\nTrip cancellation travel insurance can cover your non-refundable expenses if you’re unexpectedly forced to cancel your trip or vacation, so long as the reason is covered by your policy. Make sure you’ve purchased this coverage before your trip and preferably before you’ve made any bookings.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen you do cancel a trip, follow these tips:\\xa0\\n\\nContact your trip cancellation travel insurance company or your broker to start a claim.\\xa0\\nFill out the claims form and any other paperwork your travel insurance company sends to you.\\xa0\\nStart the cancellation process as soon as possible to maximize your chances of getting refunds.\\xa0\\xa0\\nGather any relevant documentation for the reason you’re cancelling.\\xa0\\nGet a copy of the vendor’s cancellation and refund policies. (you can find these on their website or request they be emailed or mailed to you.)\\xa0\\nKeep all receipts and communications.\\xa0\\xa0\\nProvide information of any other policies that may apply such as credit card or employee benefit travel insurance.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nSpeak to your broker for more details on trip cancellation insurance. This coverage can be very valuable – especially when cancellations are so common due to the pandemic. However, not all scenarios are covered or may be more expensive to insure. That’s why speaking to a broker is a good place to start. They’ll find you the best coverage for your budget and help you understand your trip cancellation insurance.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTags: travel insurance, trip cancellation insurance, trip interruption insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n←Previous: Faith & the Post-Pandemic World: Challenges Faced by Faith Organizations\\nNext: Where to Camp for Free in Alberta→\\n\\n')],\n",

You’ll be able to choose from numerous options to create a plan that caters to your employees’ collective needs while also aligning with the size and budget of your company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLife Insurance\\nThis type of coverage provides your employees with life insurance. In the unfortunate event that they should unexpectedly\\u202fpass away, the employee’s designated\\u202fbeneficiary will receive a sum of money. This can help employees protect their dependents and reduce financial struggles due to the loss of income.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\\nThis type of coverage is similar to life insurance but is designed to pay in the event of an accidental death. This will additionally help support the employee’s designated beneficiary and there are also payout options for dismemberment of a lost limb.\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical Illness Insurance\\nThis can help reduce the financial burden when someone is diagnosed with a serious illness such as a heart attack, cancer, organ failure or blindness. Medical conditions covered by critical illness insurance will vary depending on the individual insurer.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisability Insurance\\nIf an employee is disabled and unable to work due to an unexpected illness or accident, disability insurance can help replace a percentage of their income. This may apply to temporary and permanent disability situations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtended Healthcare\\nA group health insurance plan is a cost-effective way for employees\\u202fto get extended health insurance coverage. This can extend provincial healthcare benefits or include coverage for professional services like massage therapy, physiotherapy, psychologists and more.\\n\\n\\n\\nDental Care\\nDental care is often not covered by provincial healthcare so even routine dental care can be very expensive. It’s generally a very desirable benefit for employees. Group dental insurance is broken down into three categories – basic, major, and orthodontic – and you can choose the best one for your team.\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth and Wellness Spending Accounts\\nEmployees have access to a fixed dollar amount to spend on health and dental expenses that are not covered under provincial health care as well as general health and wellness expenses. These can include things such as gym memberships, sports equipment, personal and professional development, and more.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmployee Family Assistance Plans\\nEmployee Family Assistance Plans (EFAP) provide staff and their dependents with the support they need to work through various professional and personal challenges. Common professional services offered can include counselling services, childcare, and financial assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy choose Acera Benefits?\\nNo matter the size of your company, Acera Benefits can design, implement and manage a group benefits plan to help keep your employees healthy and productive.

Compensation packages are becoming increasingly more complex. In today’s world, employee contracts are made up of a variety of benefits.\\xa0\\nExamples of benefits within a package may include:\\n\\nHealth insurance, dental insurance, and health spending accounts (HSAs)\\nRetirement benefits and profit-sharing\\nWellness benefits (such as reimbursement for gym memberships or race registrations, weight loss programs, and smoking cessation) and well-being benefits (such as access to coaching, or meditation and fitness apps)\\n\\n\\nHow can group benefits help grow your business?\\nThe success of your business relies on talented and productive people. Employee group benefits supports your business growth by:\\n\\nAttracting top talent: HR surveys consistently show group benefits are a major factor for individuals considering a job offer.\\nImproving operational efficiency: Providing affordable and accessible group benefits can help you maintain a healthy and productive workforce.\\nCreating tax savings: In most cases, employee group benefits are tax-deductible for your business.\\nSaving time: Having Acera Insurance design, implement and maintain your group benefits plan will save your HR team valuable time and resources.\\n\\n\\nWhy do group benefits matter?\\nBenefits are important to employees because it shows them their employer is invested in their overall health and wellness. Benefits are a non-wage form of compensation that can have a direct impact on employee retention and recruitment.\\xa0\\nBenefits can help employers differentiate their business from competitors. Understanding what benefits are important to your unique group of employees is the first step in creating a competitive advantage when recruiting new talent for your organization.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does it cost to offer group benefits?\\nCosts will vary greatly depending on many factors such as the size of your group, the average age-weighted volume, and the amount of coverage you implement.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen designing the benefits program, employers can use strategies to limit or contain costs long term. These may include building deductibles or co-insurance into the coverage, or ensuring there are maximums in place to manage ongoing claims experience. Year over year, your rates will be renewed on an annual basis. Depending on the package you design, some of the benefits will be claims experience rated at renewal, and some benefits will be fully pooled.\\n\\nWhat factors should be considered when designing a group benefits package?\\nThere are a few factors that determine your group’s insurance need.\\xa0\\n\\nPooled plans spread the risk among a larger group. This can provide a stable and cost-effective way for small- to medium-sized businesses to offer a competitive benefits package to their employees. This offer is available for as low as one employee.\\nTraditional plans allow for a more tailored plan design where employers pay a monthly premium to cover the anticipated costs of their program claims, which at renewal will be calculated based on previous claims history and the carrier’s trend factors.\\nModular plans help businesses manage costs while offering a flexible benefits plan in which their employees can select from different packages to get the coverage that best aligns with their needs.\\n\\nAn Acera Benefits advisor can help you determine the option that is right for your business based on your number of employees, group demographics, historic claims patterns and budget.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroup benefits insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 20, 2025\\nThe millennial-led transformation of employee benefits plans\\nMillennials, born between 1981 and 1996, now make up the largest portion of the Canadian workforce.

Other common exclusions include liability for property damage or bodily injury to third parties (covered under wrap-up liability insurance usually purchased for each project), equipment breakdown, work vehicles (which are covered under separate policies), employee theft as well as contractors’ equipment and tools.\\n\\n\\nWarranties\\nIt’s critically important to be aware of any warranties in your policy wording. Common warranties for wood frame projects include having requirements for fencing, security, fire extinguishers, open flame or hot works procedures\\u200b, etc. Breach of a warranty voids your insurance coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment Breakdown\\nThis coverage pays for sudden and accidental damage to mechanical or electrical machinery or equipment, commonly excluded in course of construction policies. It will also pay for repair or replacement, and is particularly important during the testing and commissioning phases.\\n\\n\\nDelayed Opening/Start-up\\nThis coverage can be purchased in addition to a course of construction policy.

Boat coverage also provides extremely important liability insurance that protects you from claims related to injuries or damages caused by your vessel. Also, marine mortgage companies will often mandate you have insurance coverage as part of their lending process.\\n\\nWhat replacement coverage options are available for boats and vessels?\\nThere are three types of replacement coverage options available: guaranteed replacement cost, agreed value coverage and actual cash value coverage.\\n\\nGuaranteed Replacement Cost – this coverage most often applies to the first three years of your vessel’s life. If there is a total loss, the insurance company will replace old with new.\\nAgreed Value Coverage – this coverage is usually applicable to the first 15 to 30 years of your vessel’s life. The insurance company agrees to pay the appraised value of the vessel.\\nActual Cash Value Coverage – this coverage applies to most vessels older than 30 years. In the event of a loss, the insurance company would pay for the value of your vessel minus depreciation.\\n\\n\\nHow much is boat insurance?\\nThere are many factors which influence your boat insurance premium. These typically relate to the boat itself and include the type, age, length, value, condition, and speed of your boat. Other determining factors also include the ownership status and overall operational area.\\n\\nHow can I save money on my boat insurance?\\nThere are several ways to help save money on your boat insurance policy. Here are some cost-saving tips from Acera’s marine insurance experts:\\n\\nMaintain a clean boating record – always use safety equipment and observe the rules and regulations of the water.\\nTake a boating safety course – improving your boating skills demonstrates to insurers you have more knowledge about the hazards of the water and are less likely to get into an accident.\\nIncrease your insurance deductible – paying a higher deductible decreases your monthly payments. A deductible is the amount you pay to settle a claim before your insurance company covers the remaining amount.\\nWork with a marine insurance expert – our marine and boat insurance specialists have access to multiple carriers and can help you find the best deals possible for your vessel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is a marine insurance survey?\\nA marine survey is a comprehensive inspection which confirms the condition and value of your vessel and is performed by an independent, licensed surveyor. During the inspection, both the interior and exterior of the vessel are thoroughly examined and documented. The surveyor will provide you with a detailed report that outlines items related to the maintenance, safety, and seaworthiness of the vessel.\\n\\nWhy do I need a marine survey to get boat insurance?\\nBoat insurance companies ask for marine insurance surveys in order to best determine the value and condition of your boat. These details help inform the safety of your watercraft, in addition to the anticipated level of risk associated with operating it. Since vintage vessels are more inclined to experience more problems, insurance companies will typically ask for a survey on boats that are more than 15 years old.\\n\\nIs it possible to get boat insurance without a survey?\\nYes, there are some scenarios in which you do not need a survey to get your boat insurance. Newer vessels that are under 15 years old may not require a survey. Shorter vessels under 21 feet also do not always require one as well. If you are not certain if you require a survey to obtain your boat insurance coverage, contact one of our marine insurance specialists.\\n\\nHow much does a marine survey cost?\\nThe cost of marine surveys will vary based on both the age and size of your specific vessel. These will need to be performed by a licensed surveyor, who will typically charge a set rate per foot. Other appraisals, such as engine surveys are often billed for a set cost or fee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nNov 13, 2024\\nProtect Your Investment: How to Winterize Your Boat\\nDid you know that if your boat is not properly professionally winterized, your insurance policy may not cover certain types…Read More\\n\\n\\nApr 17, 2019\\nIs my boat covered by my home insurance?\\nWhether you use your boat for fishing, water sports, or general recreation, it’s important to have it properly insured.

Exact pricing will depend on factors (see below) like the value of your personal belongings and the particular coverage options you choose.\\n\\nWhat factors determine the price of a condo unit owner’s policy?\\nThere are several different factors that determine your policy price.\\xa0\\n\\nBuilding specifics such as:\\n\\nBuilding type (i.e., high-rise, townhouse)\\nBuilding construction materials\\nAge and type of roof\\nAge and type of electrical, plumbing and heating\\nThe installation and use of devices such as security alarms, sump pumps and more\\nProximity to a fire hydrant and fire station\\nProximity to natural hazards such as bodies of water\\n\\n\\nNeighbourhood statistics such as crime and claims rates\\nPersonal details including:\\n\\nYour age\\nYour credit rating\\nYour insurance and claims history\\nThe replacement value of your personal belongings\\nThe replacement value of your condo unit\\n\\n\\n\\nLastly, choices you make about your coverage—such as your deductible, policy limit and the addition of any endorsements—will also impact the cost of your insurance.\\n\\nWhat does the condo corporation’s insurance cover?\\nThe condo corporation’s insurance policy covers common property, including the building, common assets and any fixtures built or installed by the developer as part of the original construction.\\n\\nIf I rent out my unit, do I still need a condo unit owner’s policy?\\nYes, you will still need a separate insurance policy providing coverage for any improvements and betterments, loss assessment, personal liability, and loss of income such as expenses incurred while you are unable to rent out your unit.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I keep my rates down?\\nThere are a few ways to keep your rates down:\\xa0\\n\\nCreate an inventory to ensure you have sufficient coverage for your personal belongings and you won’t pay for coverage you don’t need.\\nInstall mitigation devices to be eligible for insurer discounts if you have smoke, carbon monoxide, water and monitored security alarms as well as devices such as sump pumps and backwater valves.\\nReview your insurance at least once a year or when you experience a major life change.\\nAllow your insurance company to run a soft credit check. This will not impact your credit rating.\\nStay insured and stay on top of insurance payments. Insurance companies reward those who’ve been consistently insured with lower rates. You can usually pay your premiums in instalments if annual payments are too difficult to make.\\xa0\\nOnly submit a claim if you can’t cover the damage yourself. Small claims can lead to big increases in your rates.\\n\\n\\nWhat types of damage is covered?\\nYour condo unit owner’s policy will cover damage to your belongings and your unit caused by accidents and hazards out of your control. Common sources of claims include:\\n\\nTheft\\nVandalism\\nFire\\nSmoke\\nExplosions\\nWind\\nWater damage (the leading cause of claims)\\n\\nThere are also additional coverages (called endorsements) that you may want to consider adding. For example, earthquake, sewer backup and overland flooding are typically not included in a standard condo unit owner’s policy.\\n\\nWhy do I need deductible assessment coverage?\\nIn the event of a claim on the condo corporation’s insurance policy, unit owners may be held responsible for paying a portion or all of the deductible. For example, if the condominium corporation has 10 owners and the master policy has a $250,000 deductible, the condo corporation could require each unit owner to contribute $25,000. If the damage is found to have originated from one unit, that unit owner could be held responsible for the entire deductible.\\nAdditionally, some condo corporation policies provide earthquake coverage with a deductible as a percentage of the entire policy limit. Deductible assessment coverage protects you from paying out of pocket if you are required to pay any part of your condo corporation’s policy deductible, which can easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 23, 2024\\nProtect your home from water damage\\nWater damage is one of the most common property insurance claims.

Do I need another policy?\\nDepending on what your employer offers, you may not need extra coverage. Make sure you take a close look at their policy and decide from there.

If you have your own separate disability insurance policy, you won’t have any interruptions if you leave your job.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does disability insurance cost?\\nIt depends on your coverage and your needs but you can probably expect premiums of about 2-5% of your salary.

It helps cover the costs of situations you couldn’t afford to pay for out of your own pocket. Most parts of farm insurance are not mandatory in Western Canada, however, you may be required to carry:\\n\\nThird-party liability, direct compensation for property damage and accident benefits coverage on vehicles\\nWorker’s Compensation coverage if you have employees\\nProperty damage coverage on leased or financed equipment\\n\\nSome contracts may also require you to carry certain types and amounts of insurance (usually liability coverage). All other coverage is optional but is recommended if you could not afford to repair or replace what was lost out of your own pocket.\\n\\nWhat’s covered by farm insurance?\\nFarm insurance can include the following coverages:\\n\\nHomes and personal property\\nFarm structures including barns, sheds, storage, and more\\nMachinery, equipment and tools\\nLivestock and crops\\nProduce or processed crops\\nLiability (legal expenses if you’re sued in certain situations)\\nFarm and personal vehicles\\nEquipment breakdown\\nBusiness interruption\\nOther protection such as additional living expenses, fire department charges, lock replacement, identity theft, and more.\\n\\nWhat’s covered by farm insurance will depend on your individual policy. That’s why it’s a good idea to work with an Acera Insurance farm advisor to ensure you have the right coverage and that you understand your policy.\\nFarm Vehicle Coverage\\nFarm vehicles are used very differently than a personal or normal commercial vehicle:\\n\\nThey are often driven fewer kilometres\\nThey are often only operated on a farm\\nThey may have special equipment or attachments\\n\\nThis means farm vehicles may require unique coverage and may qualify for special rates.

This includes things like:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWater Protection\\nThis covers things like sewer backup, heavy rain, spring run-off and overflow from lakes or rivers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Valuables\\nThis coverage protects valuables like jewellery, fine art, collectibles and more.\\n\\n\\n\\nHome-sharing\\nThis is coverage for if you rent your home through home-sharing networks like Airbnb and VRBO.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarthquake Coverage\\nThis protects your home from damage in the event of an earthquake or associated shocks (landslides, avalanches).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCyber Coverage\\nThis offers protection if you or a member of your household are a victim of a data breach, online fraud, cyberbullying and another cybercrime.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\nThis coverage can help you or a member of your household recover your identity and restore your credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy choose Acera Insurance for home coverage?\\nYour home is where you go to feel safe and secure. We think that’s how you should feel about your home insurance policy, and your advisor too. We’ll work with you to find the right coverage and make sure you’re only paying for what you truly need.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnbiased Expert Guidance\\nOur highly experienced home insurance brokers will take the guesswork out of your home insurance policy so you can focus on enjoying your home.\\n\\n\\n\\nUltimate Choice\\nAs Canada’s largest independent brokerages, we work with a large number of home insurance companies, giving you plenty of choices for your coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\nClaims Support\\nOur in-house claims team is here to help you every step of the way and advocate on your behalf to expedite your claim as quickly and efficiently as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelpful tips from our advisors.\\nOur advisors are homeowners too. We understand the expense of purchasing a home and all the time, money and effort you invest into upkeep. That’s why it makes sense to seriously consider the type of insurance you get to protect your most valuable possession.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A home inspection is very important — no matter the age of your home — as it helps identify risks like mould and foundation issues as well as provides a roadmap for areas that need upgrading.”\\n\\n\\n                                    – Kathy Grist, Client Advisor, Personal Insurance | Kelowna, BC                                \\n\\n\\n\\n“Evaluate and understand the policy coverages to verify they adequately protect you and your home. Take note of any exclusions or limitations in the policy and understand the deductible amount as it affects your out-of-pocket expenses in the event of an insured loss.”\\n\\n\\n                                    – Joshua Mena, Client Advisor, Personal Insurance | Calgary, AB                                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnswering your most common questions.\\n\\n\\nWhy do I need home insurance?\\nUnless you can afford to rebuild your home, replace your belongings, or cover the expenses of a lawsuit, home insurance can help you recover after a catastrophe. It helps ensure your long-term financial security.\\nFor example, if your home burns down in a fire, the cost of rebuilding and replacing your possessions could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars – or even more. Home insurance lessens the financial burden by helping you cover additional living costs, rebuilding or repairing your home, and replacing damaged belongings.\\nHome insurance is required if you have a mortgage, and you’ll often need to provide proof of home insurance before the lender will approve you for a mortgage.\\n\\nDoes home insurance cover lawsuits?\\nYour home insurance can help cover legal expenses if someone is injured on your property and decides to sue. Let’s say someone was in your home and tripped going down the stairs. They end up breaking an ankle and decide to sue you. Your home insurance could help cover your defence costs, as well as settlements and awards.\\n\\nWhat affects the cost of home insurance?\\nYour home insurance premiums are affected by the following factors:\\n\\nYour home’s location. This determines how far you are from fire services and risks such as bodies of water. It also considers the crime rate, and the severity and frequency of bad weather and natural disasters.\\nYour coverage options. You choose your policy limits, add-on coverage, and deductible. These all contribute to your final home insurance costs.\\nYour home itself. Factors such as the home’s systems, age, type, and construction can determine how likely it is that your home will be damaged.\\nDamage prevention or detection systems. This can include backup valves, sump pumps, water alarms, burglar alarms, security cameras and lightings, and other systems which can help you prevent or detect damage. They can get you discounts on your home insurance.\\nYour insurance history. How long you’ve been insured and your claims history impacts your homeowner insurance costs.\\n\\n\\nDo different companies have different rates?\\nEvery home insurance company may calculate home insurance rates differently. Your home insurance broker at Acera Insurance will be able to help you understand your premiums and give advice on how to reduce them.\\n\\nWhat type of damage does home insurance cover?\\nYour homeowner’s insurance covers physical damage to your home and other structures such as decks, fences, garages, and sheds. It also includes protection for your personal belongings and furniture. Here are just some of the causes of physical damage often covered by home insurance:\\n\\nFire (including wildfire)\\nExplosion\\nLightning\\nHail\\nWind and tornadoes\\nTheft\\nVandalism\\nBurst pipes\\n\\nExactly what’s covered varies by policy and home insurance company. That’s why it’s important to talk to a knowledgeable home insurance broker.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about severe weather and flooding?\\nYou may also want to consider purchasing add-ons (called endorsements) toextend the coverage of your existing policy to provide protection from severe weather or unexpected events like:\\n\\nEarthquakes\\nOverland water\\nSewer backup\\nGround water\\n\\n\\nHow can I lower the cost of my home insurance?\\nOne of our expert brokers can help determine how much coverage you need, find you competitive rates and discuss your eligibility for any discounts or bundling savings. For example, you may qualify for a discount if you purchase your home and auto insurance through the same provider.\\nOther ways that you can manage your home insurance rates include:\\n\\nInstalling safety features in your home, like security and smoke alarms.\\nFixing small repairs by yourself rather than making a claim. The more\\u202fclaims you make, the higher your rates will be to reflect this.\\nIncreasing your deductible by a reasonable amount.\\nPracticing proper home maintenance.\\n\\n\\nWhat other coverage options are available to me?\\u202f\\nHome insurance is incredibly customizable to reflect the individual requirements of every home and family. Certain add-ons (called endorsements) may be available to extend your homeowner insurance to include high-value items, such as boats or other watercrafts, or increased policy limits.\\n\\nWhat can I expect if I choose Acera for my home insurance?\\nAn Acera Insurance home insurance broker will help you with the following:\\n\\nDetermine your home insurance needs\\nDeliver competitive homeowners insurance quotes\\nAdvise and act as your personal home insurance resource\\nAdvocate on your behalf if you have a claim\\nAid in risk management for your home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Trampolines, treehouses and playsets\\nBefore you build a backyard full of fun, make sure you understand what your home insurance covers when it comes…Read More\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Firepits and barbecues\\nFirepits and barbecues can add warmth and flavour to your outdoor space, but they also come with safety risks and…Read More\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Hosting a party\\nHosting a summer party?

Certain provinces provide drug coverage beginning at age 65, but these initiatives may be limited by a drug formulary that excludes prescription drugs that you now use or may need to take. Because private health insurance often covers twice as much for prescription medicines as most government coverage, plans like Canada Life’s Freedom to Choose health and dental insurance might be helpful for you.\\n\\nWhat if I don’t need extra coverage?\\nYou can still use the plans to help cover the cost of other health needs as you get older, such as home health care, mobility devices and hearing aids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nApr 1, 2024\\nReturning home after a wildfire\\nFlames, soot, ash and firefighting techniques to fight wildfires can cause damage to your home and belongings.

Whether you’re doing the work, hiring contractors, or a mix of both, your advisor needs to know that changes are being made.\\nHere are some of the reasons why:\\n\\nIf the property is vacant during renovations, your policy may only offer limited coverage or be voided entirely\\nRenovations can increase your home’s value\\nRenovations can reveal deeper issues or add risks to your home (ie. installing a pool)\\nThe risk of someone getting hurt while at the home increases\\nThere is a higher chance of damage to your home\\nThere may be a higher likelihood of a burglary\\n\\n\\nDo I need extra coverage during renovations?\\nDepending on the extent of the renovation, you may need special protection called course of construction insurance. Also known as builder’s risk insurance, this coverage protects investment properties that are under construction or being renovated.\\n\\nDoes homeowner insurance protect my investment property?\\nHomeowner insurance protects your primary residence. You will need a standalone investment property insurance policy to protect any property for which the sole intention is to generate an additional revenue stream, whether through long-term rentals or flipping.\\nThis is different from a secondary or seasonal home that you and your family spend time at for parts of the year, and perhaps welcome short-term rentals while you’re away. In this instance, you will need a seasonal property policy.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does it cost to insure an investment property?\\nThe cost of insuring an investment rental property will depend on several factors, including:\\n\\nWhere the property is located\\n\\nProximity to a fire hydrant and fire station\\nProximity to hazards such as rivers\\nThe claim rate of the area\\nThe crime rate of the area\\nThe type and frequency of natural disasters\\n\\n\\nThe home’s build and materials\\n\\nSquare footage\\nType of building (apartment, townhouse, single family home)\\nThe age of the house\\nThe type and age of the roof\\nThe type and age of the home’s systems such as plumbing, heating and electrical\\n\\n\\nIf the home has a pool or trampoline or similar risk\\nThe cost of rebuilding the home and replacing all the contents\\nYour insurance and claims history\\nYour insurance options, including coverage, deductible and policy limits\\n\\nThe cost can vary a lot, even between neighbours with similar homes. An experienced investment property insurance broker can work with you to help you determine the cost of protecting your real estate and help you find the best coverage for the best price.\\n\\nWhat types of risks does investment property insurance cover?\\nCommon risks that investment property insurance covers include:\\n\\nFire\\nSmoke\\nExplosion\\nImpact by aircraft or vehicle\\nLightning\\nWind\\nHail\\nVandalism and other malicious acts\\nTheft\\nWeight of ice or snow causing roof collapse\\nCertain types of water damage\\n\\nProtection from earthquakes, sewer backup and overland water/flooding may be available but is an add-on coverage, known as an endorsement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Trampolines, treehouses and playsets\\nBefore you build a backyard full of fun, make sure you understand what your home insurance covers when it comes…Read More\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Firepits and barbecues\\nFirepits and barbecues can add warmth and flavour to your outdoor space, but they also come with safety risks and…Read More\\n\\n\\nJun 13, 2025\\nManaging your backyard risks: Hosting a party\\nHosting a summer party?

Different drivers for the same car or the same driver for different vehicles can have drastically different rates. Overall, luxury auto insurance tends to be more expensive than regular car insurance. This is largely because a collectible or luxury vehicle isn’t like a regular car. It is generally more costly to work on the repairs of a luxury vehicle since they often require specific or original parts and more specialized mechanical skills. Theft is often more of a risk with luxury vehicles, and it is more expensive to replace these types of vehicles when they are stolen.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does luxury auto insurance cost?\\nThe cost to insure your luxury automobile in Canada will vary based on several factors related to you, the vehicle, and your location.

This cost includes all the expenses required to rebuild the home – from exterior and interior structural elements to high-end, built-in appliances.\\nHigh-value properties may often be distinguished by having unique architectural details, custom-designed features and specialty home systems or equipment. Some insurers may only provide high-value home insurance to million-dollar properties.\\n\\nHow much does high-value home insurance cost?\\nThe cost of high-value or luxury home insurance will depend on your individual policy. Here are some of the factors that influence premiums:\\n\\nYour insurance and claims history\\nYour credit rating\\nThe year your home was built\\nThe age and type of systems (electrical, plumbing, heating, etc.) in your home\\nThe age and material of the roof\\nThe building materials used in your home\\nYour proximity to risks such as rivers\\nThe distance from your home to the nearest fire hydrant and fire station\\nThe presence of security features such as cameras, lighting, and alarms\\nThe presence of damage mitigation devices such as a sump pump, backflow valve, water alarm, and smoke detector\\nThe frequency of natural disasters in your area\\nThe crime and claim rate of your area\\nThe cost of rebuilding your home (including local material and labour costs)\\nThe value of your home’s contents\\nYour custom home insurance options, including coverages, policy limits, and the deductible\\n\\n\\nIs high-value home insurance more expensive than standard home insurance?\\nYes, high-value home insurance policies are typically more expensive than standard home insurance policies. The cost to insure your home is generally based on the overall value of your home, in addition to the value of its contents.

Here are some tips to save on your motorcycle insurance premium.\\n\\nCompare quotes from multiple providers. Working with a broker is an easy and effective way to review your options. As a trusted expert, they shop the market for you, explain the details and answer all your questions.\\nBundle with your home or auto insurance. This can potentially help you secure a lower rate.\\nInsure multiple motorcycles under one policy. Drivers with several motorcycles typically pay less by insuring all of their bikes under one motorcycle policy instead of individually.\\nInstall an anti-theft device. This lowers the chance of being stolen and reduces the insurance company’s risk of replacement costs.\\xa0\\nHave adequate storage. If you can guarantee a safe, well-kept storage space for your motorcycle, you reduce the chances of damage during the winter, and mitigate theft.\\nTake a motorcycle training course. Completing a motorcycle safety course can provide information on how to reduce risks and help drivers better react to dangerous situations.\\n\\n\\nWhat motorcycle has the cheapest insurance rates?\\nWhen looking at the motorcycle itself, the cubic centimetres (CC) of your bike, in addition to the horsepower, weight and torque have the greatest impact on what you can expect to pay.\\nSmaller bikes with less powerful engines are generally cheaper to insure than high power motorcycles. Expensive sports bikes, luxury or collector motorcycles come with greater risks as they are also more likely to be stolen and would require more costly repairs in the event of a claim. This is also why mopeds, scooters and standard cruisers usually have lower insurance rates.\\n\\n\\n\\nShould I insure my motorcycle during the winter?\\nThere are several benefits to maintaining your motorcycle insurance coverage year-round. Many policies include storage coverage. This means whenever your bike is not being ridden, you would have coverage if it is stolen, vandalized, or damaged by fire, attempted theft, falling objects and more.\\nIf you cancel your insurance in the winter, you will also have a gap in coverage. Coverage gaps may affect your future premium costs when you need to secure coverage again the next season.\\n\\nHow does motorcycle insurance differ across provinces?\\nSome coverages are mandatory depending on the province, while others are optional. An Acera Insurance advisor can help you understand the unique requirements within your province. In general though, these are the main differences:\\n\\nAccident benefits coverage is mandatory in all provinces except Newfoundland.\\nDirect Compensation Property Damage Coverage (DCPD) is in place in Alberta, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec.\\nCollision coverage is optional in most provinces, but required in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\\nUninsured motorist coverage is mandatory in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.\\xa0\\nIn British Columbia, Third Party Legal Liability Coverage must be purchased from ICBC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nNov 16, 2022\\nWhy do I need motorcycle insurance in Victoria?\\nA motorcycle may cost a significant amount less than your average vehicle, but its insurance coverage is just as important.…Read More\\n\\n\\nNov 9, 2022\\nTips For Buying Your First Motorcycle in Nanaimo\\nBuying Your First Motorcycle in Nanaimo, BC: Pro tips from Acera Insurance If you’re in the market for your first…Read More\\n\\n\\nNov 2, 2022\\nTop Motorcycle Safety Tips in Courtenay\\nMotorcycle Safety Tips for Courtenay Motorists In British Columbia, and here at Acera Insurance, we all love our bikes and…Read More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStill have questions?\\nWe’re happy to connect with you.

There are four main reasons to insure your RV even if it’s parked and you’re not using it:\\xa0\\n\\nYour RV can be damaged at any time\\nIt can cause damage or injury at any time even if it’s parked\\nYou might be legally or contractually obligated to have your RV insured\\nRV insurance is priced for year-round coverage so you’ll see higher prices and may not be able to get coverage if you cancel seasonally\\n\\n\\nIs hail damage covered by RV insurance?\\nIf you have property coverage on your RV and no hail exclusion, then yes, your RV insurance will cover hail damage. If you don’t have property damage coverage, such as a motorhome with third-party liability only, you would not have hail coverage.\\n\\nIs RV insurance required?\\nIf you have a motorhome, you are required to carry a minimum amount of third-party liability, accident benefits and direct compensation for property damage insurance like any other vehicle on the road. The exact requirements vary by province, as auto insurance is provincially regulated.\\nYou may also be required to have insurance for your RV if it’s financed. This is often required by the lender to ensure their asset is protected. RV insurance can also offer you peace of mind and financial security if an accident should happen.\\n\\nWhat affects RV insurance rates?\\nRV insurance rates are impacted by:\\xa0\\n\\nThe make, model and year of your RV\\nYour driving record\\nYour insurance history (how many claims and what type of claims you’ve had, how long you’ve been insured)\\nCoverage options and limits\\nDeductible amount\\nHow you use your RV\\nCredit history\\nIf you’re eligible for discounts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes RV insurance cover my personal belongings?\\nYes, if you have property coverage as part of your RV insurance policy, your personal belongings are covered, as long as they’re damaged or destroyed by an insured peril like fire. Some items may not be covered to their full value like jewellery, electronics and sports equipment like bicycles. Toys like jet skis, dirt bikes and ATVs need separate coverage.\\nSpeak to a broker to make sure you’ve got the right protection and amount of coverage needed for your belongings.\\n\\nCan I just add my RV to my home insurance policy?\\nIn some cases, yes you can try to add your RV or trailer to your home insurance policy but not all home insurance companies will let you. Make sure to evaluate if the coverage meets your needs and keep in mind that a claim on your trailer would be a claim on your home insurance policy.\\n\\nIs my trailer covered by my auto insurance while I’m towing it?\\nAside from third-party liability coverage, your auto insurance does not cover your trailer, even while you’re towing it. If you were to get into an accident, the damage to your trailer wouldn’t be covered – unless you went after another at-fault driver who caused the damage.\\n\\nAm I covered if I take my RV across the border?\\nOur policies do offer coverage for your RV travel in the U.S. However, there may be a limit on how long you can be in the U.S. each year. Most policies do not cover travel to Mexico.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nJan 5, 2023\\nQuestions to Ask Before Buying an RV\\nThere are a LOT of questions to ask before you buy an RV.

This leaves your property open to harm and makes it a criminal target. As well, because no one is around, damage may go unnoticed and result in far greater issues than if it is discovered right away.

Losses are common when renting to unknown individuals. Reviewing your insurance policy and taking the time to ensure you have proper insurance is crucial.”\\n\\n\\n                                    – Holly Slusar, Client Executive, Signature Insurance | Parksville, BC                                \\n\\n\\n\\n“If you rent out your home or condo on a short-term basis, it’s crucial to notify your broker as it may impact your standard homeowners or condo insurance policy.”\\n\\n\\n                                    – Stacy Forrest, Team Leader, Personal Insurance | Brampton, ON                                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnswering your most common questions.\\n\\n\\nDo I need short-term rental insurance if I already have homeowner’s insurance?\\nMost standard homeowner’s policies exclude coverage for business activities like short-term rentals. Not having proper insurance can leave you financially exposed in case of unexpected events.\\n\\nHow much does short-term rental insurance cost?\\nThe cost of short-term rental insurance depends on several factors, including:\\n\\nLocation of your property\\nValue of your property and contents\\nCoverage limits\\nFrequency of rentals\\nDeductible amount\\n\\n\\nIf I’m part of a short-term rental platform, doesn’t that cover me?\\nRental platforms, like Vrbo or AirBnB, offer some coverage but there’s no guarantee that it will be enough for the right coverage for you. Having your own coverage ensures that you have all the coverage you need, no matter what happens.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s the difference between short-term rental insurance and home insurance? Do I need both?\\nHome insurance is designed for your personal residence and protects you from damage, theft, and liability when you live there. On the other hand, short-term rental insurance specifically covers your property and potential liabilities when you rent it out to guests through platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo for up to 6 months. It fills the gaps in traditional homeowner’s insurance, which often excludes coverage for business activities like short-term rentals. If you’re renting out your home or secondary residence, you should think about getting short-term coverage.\\n\\nDo I have to get short-term rental insurance?\\nNo, you are not required by law to get short-term rental insurance but we highly recommend you do so in order to protect yourself. Hosting platforms, such as Airbnb and Vrbo, strongly recommend that you have your own insurance instead of solely relying on theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nApr 12, 2021\\nHard to Insure Homes\\nFor most homeowners, insuring their home is straightforward.

However, rates do vary based on several factors, including:\\n\\nType of building (i.e., high-rise condo, house, etc.)\\nBuilding construction material\\nDistance to the nearest fire hydrant and fire station\\nLocation and neighbourhood specifics (i.e., crime rate, proximity to natural hazards like rivers, etc.)\\nYour insurance and claims history\\nThe replacement value of your personal belongings\\n\\nThe deductible, policy limit and any additional coverages you choose will also make a difference in your tenant insurance premium.\\n\\nIs tenant insurance mandatory in Canada?\\nWhile you are not legally mandated to carry tenant insurance in Canada, landlords will often require tenant insurance as a condition in their lease agreements. A minimum amount of coverage may also be specified in the lease wording. A copy of your insurance policy may be requested before you moving in.\\n\\nWhat is not covered by tenant insurance?\\nTenant insurance is designed to cover your costs for accidental and unexpected incidents. The following is excluded in standard tenant insurance policies:\\n\\nWear and tear\\nRegular maintenance\\nRust or corrosion\\nMould\\nSlow seepage and leaks\\nDamage by rodents, insects, and animals\\nDamage caused by negligence or lack of maintenance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill my tenant insurance cover my roommate(s)?\\nWhile tenant insurance will usually cover your family members, it does not automatically extend to everyone that lives with you. While it is possible to add roommates onto one policy, it is not advised as a claim filed by your roommate could have an impact on your claims history and premiums in the future. We recommend every roommate to have their own tenant insurance policy.\\n\\nWhat causes of damage are covered by tenant insurance?\\nCommon sources of claims that are covered include:\\n\\nTheft\\nVandalism\\nFire\\nSmoke\\nExplosion\\nWind\\nHail\\nImpact by vehicle or aircraft\\nImpact by falling object (like a tree)\\n\\nSpecial endorsements must be added to cover damage caused by earthquake, sewer backup and overland water (flooding). These endorsements may not be offered by all insurers or available to all clients. Get in touch with your Acera Insurance advisor for more information.\\n\\nWhat types of claims are included under personal liability coverage?\\nThe personal liability coverage included under tenant insurance provides protection against claims resulting from injuries and damage to other people or property. This includes legal costs and any settlements to be paid if you are found responsible and legally liable. This coverage extends to you anywhere in the world.\\nCommon scenarios could include:\\n\\nSomeone slipping and falling on your property\\nYou are on a golf course and hit a ball into somebody’s living room window\\nYou are on vacation and accidentally start a fire that causes property damage\\nYou open an umbrella on the street and injure a bystander’s eye and are sued for the medical expenses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal insurance insights for your everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 21, 2024\\nUnderstanding additional living expenses insurance\\nAdditional living expenses can help cover your increased cost of living when you’re unable to stay at your residence due…Read More\\n\\n\\nJan 4, 2022\\nAm I covered by my landlord’s insurance?\\nUnder Alberta’s Residential Tenancies Act, a landlord is only responsible for ensuring the rental premises are habitable.

Make sure you understand what the coverage includes and what exclusions apply. A separate policy may be beneficial if your credit card coverage isn’t adequate for your needs. We commonly see that credit cards\\xa0 don’t provide enough coverage, not enough days or trips are covered, they have age restrictions, coverage doesn’t include trip cancellation, and it may not cover anyone travelling with you.\\n\\nI’m travelling to another province in Canada, do I really need travel insurance?\\nYes, as medical expenses may not be fully covered if you’re outside of your province of residence, even if you’re travelling in Canada.\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to mountaineer, heli-ski, ice climb or do another “high-risk” activity, can I get coverage?\\nYes!

We offer a variety of art insurance policies, each designed to meet the specific needs of your collection.\\nFAQs\\n\\n\\nWhy should I get an appraisal?\\nAn appraisal of your art is not always required for insurance. It will depend on how much you’d like to insure your piece(s) for and the individual insurance company. However, appraisals are a good idea to ensure the true value of your art is known. Generally, insurers recommend an appraisal to be done every 3-5 years. The frequency depends on the art and if its value is changing in the marketplace.\\n\\nHow do I get an appraisal done?\\nIf you do get an appraisal, it should be done by a qualified appraiser. Generally, these appraisers write to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). They should also belong to the International Society of Appraisers. Your Acera Insurance advisor can provide appraiser recommendations. Your chosen appraiser should charge by the hour or with a flat fee. They should not bill based on the value of the object they’re appraising.\\n\\nAre challenges to ownership covered under fine art insurance?\\nChallenges to ownership is usually excluded under art insurance policies. Art title protection is a specialized coverage that will help cover legal expenses relating to ownership challenges. It’s usually available as a one-time purchase which will stay in effect so long as the owner (and their heirs) possesses the artwork. Generally, premiums are between 1-3% of the value of the artwork.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the different ways to insure my art collection?\\nThe three types include:\\xa0\\n\\nScheduled\\xa0Individually itemized, where each piece of art has a different value and coverage\\n\\n\\nBlanket The whole collection is protected with a per-item maximum\\n\\n\\nCombinationSchedule some pieces and leave the rest under a blanket policy\\n\\n\\nWhat is the most important information to keep in a catalogue/inventory of my artwork?\\n\\nA unique inventory number assigned to each artwork\\xa0\\nThe location of each artwork which refers to where it is currently i.e. gallery, museum, etc.)\\xa0\\nThe place of storage for each artwork which refers to where it is kept when not on display (i.e. home, storage facility, etc.)\\nEdition number (indicates the size of an edition which determines price and helps identify forgeries)\\nPurchase price\\nSelling price\\nCurrent market value\\nCosts incurred for each artwork (i.e. framing, transportation, restoration, authentication,\\xa0 insurance, etc.)\\nDimensions\\nImages (ideally taken by professional photographers)\\xa0\\nCertificates\\n\\nYou should also have digital backups of your catalogue/inventory, as well. Some insurance companies do not require this level of detail for a blanket art insurance policy. However, it is always good practice to have all of this information collected (or as much as possible).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJewellery Insurance\\nWe understand that insurance can’t always truly replace what was lost – a family heirloom or an antique or your wedding ring will have sentimental value that is irreplaceable. However, jewellery insurance can help repair a damaged piece or allow you to rebuild your collection.\\nFAQs\\n\\n\\nHow much does jewellery insurance cost?\\nThe cost of jewellery insurance is dependant on the following factors:\\n\\nThe value of the pieces you’re insuring.\\nYour coverage, including settlement options and policy limits.\\nThe crime rates of where you live.\\nHow the jewellery is stored including any security protocols and features.\\nYour insurance and claims history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do I get my jewellery appraised?\\nFind a qualified gemologist through the Canadian Jewellers Association to accurately identify your diamonds and gemstones for authenticity and value.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWine and Spirit Insurance\\nGiven the expanding market for wine and spirits, safeguarding your valuables is increasingly crucial to ensure they can be replaced in case of theft, breakage, spoilage, or damage.\\nFAQs\\n\\n\\nIn what ways can I customize my wine and spirit insurance?\\n\\nSpecific Perils: This is the cause of damage that you are and aren’t protected from, such as accidental breakage, access to light, temperature change, vibration and humidity.\\xa0\\nBlanket vs. Individual or Itemized: Blanket policies have a maximum payout per bottle which eliminates the need for an appraisal while individual or itemized policies insure each bottle separately and requires appraisals for proper valuation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow factors affect the cost of wine and spirit insurance?\\n\\nThe value of your collection\\nWhere and how you store your wine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial Collections Insurance\\nArt galleries and dealers are frequently buying and selling pieces to clients worldwide, requiring constant installation, de-installation, handling, and shipping of artworks.

If not, find a small space on the ground floor (i.e., bathroom, closet, hallway).\\nIf you’re in an office or apartment building, move to an inner hallway or room, ideally on the ground floor or basement, if possible. Do not use the elevator during a tornado.\\nIf you’re in a mobile home or trailer, immediately seek shelter elsewhere. If a secure, solid structure is not nearby, take shelter in a ditch or other low-lying area, and cover your head.\\nIf you are on a farm, seek shelter indoors as outlined above. Do not attempt to shelter your livestock if you are under a direct threat from a tornado. Remember, tornadoes can be deceiving; a twister can appear to be stationary when it is actually quickly moving towards you, and it can also change direction rapidly without warning.\\nNever try to outrun a nearby tornado if you are driving. Seek shelter inside. If this is not possible, lay down in a ditch or other low-lying area, away from your vehicle, covering your head.\\nIf you are caught outdoors, lay down in a ditch or low-lying area, and cover your head for protection. Do not seek shelter under an overpass or bridge — you’ll be safer in a low-lying area.

This area should be free of all flammable materials. This includes dry grass and vegetation, firewood, fuel and combustible plants.\\n \\nIt’s also recommended that any exterior properties, such as decks and sheds, be built of fire-resistant materials. Or, if possible, located more than 10 metres from your home.\\n \\nFirewood should be stored more than 10 metres away from your home. As well, it should be stored in a fire-resistant box or covered with a fire-resistant tarp.\\n \\nOpt for patio furniture that is made of non-combustible materials (i.e., metal) or keep it away from your home.\\n \\nWildfire defence zone two\\n \\nYour goal for the remainder of your property is to reduce and properly maintain any vegetation that feeds a wildfire.\\n \\nRegularly remove dead or unhealthy plants, including roots and stumps, and also rake leaves and twigs. Thin and prune your trees so they are at least three to six metres apart. Regularly mow and water your grass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        02                    \\n\\n                        Prepare your home for wildfire season                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to creating a wildfire defence zone around your property, you can protect your property from wildfire damage by:\\n\\nInspecting your chimney at least twice a year and ensuring you’re cleaning the chimney at least once a year. Keep the dampers in good working order.\\nInvesting in a portable air cleaner to keep indoor air pollution levels low in the event of smoky conditions.\\nRegularly clean and clear debris from your roof and gutters as embers can easily set these alight.\\nUse fire-resistant building materials if possible (i.e., metal or treated asphalt shingles, brick siding). Wood and vinyl are highly flammable.\\nTempered and thermal windows and doors can help minimize the likelihood of heat from a wildfire growing through the glass. This stops it from igniting the inside of your property.\\nEnsure any explosive materials (i.e., propane, gas) is stored and located at least six metres away from your home. Other fuel sources, like firewood, should be covered with fire-resistant covers.\\n\\nHow to secure your home in the event of a wildfire evacuation\\n\\nClose all windows and doors.\\nSeal vents and openings.\\nIf possible, bring inside any patio furniture or other outdoor furniture.\\nEnsure any fuel sources (i.e., firewood, explosive materials) are located at least six metres away from your home.\\nWater down the roof, the home’s exterior and immediate surrounding areas.\\nHave your water hoses connected and ready for use.\\nTurn off the gas.\\nEnsure emergency services can easily access your property if needed. Make sure your property is well marked, access is clear and that any gates are left open if possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding wildfire insurance for your home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStandard property insurance policies are homeowner insurance, condo insurance, tenant insurance. These provide coverage for damage caused by wildfires, including damage caused by smoke and water resulting from the fire.\\nThat said, these coverages can vary with each insurer and policy. It’s best to discuss your specific wildfire coverage with your Acera Insurance advisor. When reviewing your policy, we advise that you take into consideration the following:\\n\\nIs your coverage limit sufficient to cover the costs of replacing, repairing or rebuilding your home after wildfire damage?\\nIs your coverage limit sufficient to cover any loss of fine art, collectibles, jewellery or other valuables in your home? Standard property insurance policies tend to limit the amount they’ll cover for these items. You may want to consider having separate insurance to protect your costly valuables\\nIs your home currently undergoing any renovations? If you recently completed renovations, is the new value of your home reflected in your policy?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        01                    \\n\\n                        Other insurance that offers you coverage in the event of a wildfire                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour property insurance policy could be homeowner insurance, condo insurance or tenant insurance. These can all provide coverages that can be useful in the event of a wildfire.\\n\\nAdditional living expenses. These can help cover your increased living costs related to temporary relocation, such as a hotel, storage fees and eating out. For if you’re unable to live in your home following an insured loss as a result of a wildfire. I.e. property damage, mandatory evacuation order. Many insurers will reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses. Be sure to keep your receipts for extra expenses incurred while displaced from your home and your normal living expenses. \\nFood spoilage.\\xa0This can help replace your fridge or freezer’s contents if a wildfire causes a power outage or technical malfunction.\\n\\n\\n \\nWe recommend that you speak with your Acera Insurance advisor to discuss your coverage limits. Check additional living expenses and food spoilage to ensure your needs are covered in the event of a flood-related loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        02                    \\n\\n                        Understanding home insurance deductibles in the event of wildfire damage                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour home insurance will include the deductible amount you selected when purchasing the policy. This is the amount you have agreed to pay in the event of a covered claim.\\n \\nFor example, imagine your property suffers $5,000 in wildfire damage. If your policy has a $1,000 deductible, your insurer will pay a maximum of $4,000 for the claim.\\n \\nDepending on your policy and insurer, your additional living expenses and food spoilage coverages may be subject to a deductible.\\n \\nIf you have any questions about the deductible listed in your home insurance policy, please contact your Acera Insurance advisor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        03                    \\n\\n                        Why a home inventory list is important for wildfire insurance claims                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeeping and maintaining a home inventory list can streamline the claims process if your property sustains fire-related damage. Make sure it’s covered by your policy. We recommend you update your list at least once a year. Here are four tips to help you create and safely store a home inventory list:\\n\\nWalk around your house and document your possessions. You can record these details either in a list or by taking photographs. Try to capture a detailed description of the product, a serial number, the purchase date and estimated value.\\nKeep and safely store your receipts. If you’re trying to minimize paper clutter, save your receipts digitally.\\nYou may want to consider creating 360-degree view videos of both the interior and exterior of your property. This can help you keep track of your items and any upgrades to your property.\\nStore your home inventory in a safe spot, including keeping one copy offsite. Digital copies should be backed up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        04                    \\n\\n                        What to do if you have questions about wildfire insurance for your home?                     \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions about the wildfire coverage provided in your home, condo or tenant insurance policy?

They are higher in Western Canada.\\nFor example, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, notable wildfires across the country accounted for $780 million in insured losses in 2023 alone. The all-time costliest severe weather insurable loss on record is the Fort McMurray, AB. Wildfire in 2016 that cost nearly $6 billion alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        02                    \\n\\n                        Do insurers consider wildfires an uninsurable “Act of God?”                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. In most cases, wildfires are covered by standard property insurance policies (i.e., homeowner insurance, commercial property insurance).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        03                    \\n\\n                        Can I update my insurance policy once the threat of a wildfire is imminent?                    \\n\\n\\nToggle accordion section\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. You cannot update or change your home, business or farm insurance when under threat of a wildfire.

You can learn more about co-insurance in our 2024 market forecast.\\nFurthermore, the amount you’ll receive for covered damage will also depend on if you have opted to be reimbursed for losses based on replacement cost or actual cash value. The equation insurers use for actual cash value includes a depreciation calculation, whereas replacement cost does not factor in depreciation. Some policies also offer a clause called guaranteed replacement cost. This will cover the cost to repair or rebuild on the same site with similar materials. It covers you, even if the costs exceed your policy limits.\\nIf you have any questions about the wildfire coverage your policy offers, please contact an Acera Insurance advisor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional severe weather resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlood preparedness guide\\n\\n\\nLearn how to insure your home and business against flooding and how to minimize flood damage.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHail preparedness guide\\n\\n\\nLearn how to insure your home and business against hail and how to minimize damage caused by these storms.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarthquake preparedness guide\\n\\n\\nEarthquakes are unpredictable and can cause significant damage to homes, vehicles, businesses and farms in a short period of time.

       "  ToolMessage(content='Helpful tips from our advisors.\\nKeep your space and belongings protected. Our advisors are here to help you find the right coverage for you.\\n“Your landlord’s insurance will not cover your personal property you brought into the home nor would it cover those additional expenses should you be faced with being forced out of your home due to a mass evacuation or loss. Your comprehensive tenant insurance policy is personal to protecting you.”\\n – Carol Moeller, Client Advisor | Kelowna, BC“Tenant insurance protects more than just your personal belongings. Working with experienced brokers is essential to ensure you have the coverage physical damage. Don’t take any chances when it comes to your financial security. Let the experts help you get the protection you need.”\\n – Sheralea Moon Raymond, Client Advisor | Fort McMurray, AB \\nAnswering your most common questions.\\nHow much does tenant insurance cost?\\nTenant insurance is usually offered at a monthly or annual fee that is affordable to most Canadians. However, rates do vary based on several factors, including:\\n\\nType of building (i.e., high-rise condo, house, etc.)\\nBuilding construction material\\nDistance to the nearest fire hydrant and fire station\\nLocation and neighbourhood specifics (i.e., crime rate, proximity to natural hazards like rivers, etc.)\\nYour insurance and claims history\\nThe replacement value of your personal belongings\\n\\nThe deductible, policy limit and any additional coverages you choose will also make a difference in your tenant insurance premium.\\n\\nIs tenant insurance mandatory in Canada?\\nWhile you are not legally mandated to carry tenant insurance in Canada, landlords will often require tenant insurance as a condition in their lease agreements. A minimum amount of coverage may also be specified in the lease wording. A copy of your insurance policy may be requested before you moving in.\\n\\nWhat is not covered by tenant insurance?\\nTenant insurance is designed to cover your costs for accidental and unexpected incidents. The following is excluded in standard tenant insurance policies:\\n\\nWear and tear\\nRegular maintenance\\nRust or corrosion\\nMould\\nSlow seepage and leaks\\nDamage by rodents, insects, and animals\\nDamage caused by negligence or lack of maintenance\\nWill my tenant insurance cover my roommate(s)?\\nWhile tenant insurance will usually cover your family members, it does not automatically extend to everyone that lives with you. While it is possible to add roommates onto one policy, it is not advised as a claim filed by your roommate could have an impact on your claims history and premiums in the future. We recommend every roommate to have their own tenant insurance policy.\\n\\nWhat causes of damage are covered by tenant insurance?\\nCommon sources of claims that are covered include:\\n\\nTheft\\nVandalism\\nFire\\nSmoke\\nExplosion\\nWind\\nHail\\nImpact by vehicle or aircraft\\nImpact by falling object (like a tree)\\n\\nSpecial endorsements must be added to cover damage caused by earthquake, sewer backup and overland water (flooding). These endorsements may not be offered by all insurers or available to all clients. Get in touch with your Acera Insurance advisor for more information.\\n\\nTenant Insurance\\nInsure your space to ensure your peace.\\nWhether you rent a house, townhome or condo, as a tenant, you’re vulnerable to many of the same risks as your landlord. The expert advisors at Acera Insurance are here to help make sure you and your personal belongings are properly protected.\\n\\nGet a Quote\\nYour guide to tenant insurance.\\nYour landlord’s insurance protects only the building itself and the contents owned by the landlord. This is where tenant insurance comes in.\\nWhat your tenant insurance can cover:\\n\\nLoss or damage to your personal belongings such as furniture, appliances, clothing and electronics\\xa0\\nYour liability in the event someone is injured inside the home and pursues legal action\\nAny expenses you incur for having to relocate temporarily while repairs are being done due to a claim or an evacuation\\nCoverage across Canada.\\nGet your tenant insurance by phone or in person at your nearest branch.\\n\\nGet a Quote\\nFind a Branch\\nExplore your insurance options as a tenant.\\nWith decades of experience and expertise, your Acera Insurance advisors provide personalized, professional advice and customizable, competitively priced coverage that’s perfectly fit for your needs.\\nPersonal Property\\nCoverage for loss or damage to your personal belongings (e.g. furniture, appliances, clothing, electronics) due to common causes such as theft, fire and vandalism.\\nPersonal Liability\\nCovers your legal expenses if you are sued and held responsible for accidentally causing damage to your landlord or neighbour’s property, or someone is injured while visiting your rental unit.\\nAdditional Living Expenses\\nCovers the cost of alternate accommodation, such as a hotel or rental unit, while your rental unit is under repair due to a covered loss or an evacuation order.\\nReplacement Cost Coverage\\nYour policy will pay to restore damaged or lost possessions to their original condition or buy replacements of similar kind and quality.

      "“Your landlord’s insurance will not cover your personal property you brought into the home nor would it cover those additional expenses should you be faced with being forced out of your home due to a mass evacuation or loss. Your comprehensive tenant insurance policy is personal to protecting you.”\n",

      "Answering your most common questions.\n",
      "How much does tenant insurance cost?\n",
      "Tenant insurance is usually offered at a monthly or annual fee that is affordable to most Canadians. However, rates do vary based on several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Type of building (i.e., high-rise condo, house, etc.)\n",
      "Building construction material\n",
      "Distance to the nearest fire hydrant and fire station\n",
      "Location and neighbourhood specifics (i.e., crime rate, proximity to natural hazards like rivers, etc.)\n",
      "Your insurance and claims history\n",
      "The replacement value of your personal belongings\n",
      "\n",
      "The deductible, policy limit and any additional coverages you choose will also make a difference in your tenant insurance premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is tenant insurance mandatory in Canada?\n",
      "While you are not legally mandated to carry tenant insurance in Canada, landlords will often require tenant insurance as a condition in their lease agreements. A minimum amount of coverage may also be specified in the lease wording. A copy of your insurance policy may be requested before you moving in.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is not covered by tenant insurance?\n",

      "Will my tenant insurance cover my roommate(s)?\n",
      "While tenant insurance will usually cover your family members, it does not automatically extend to everyone that lives with you.

We recommend every roommate to have their own tenant insurance policy.\n",
